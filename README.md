## Features

- TypeScript support for writing more maintainable and structured code.
- Integration of Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- Mocha test framework for structuring and running test cases.
- Configuration for setting implicit timeouts and test reporters.
- Sample test files to demonstrate usage.
